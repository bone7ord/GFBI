            <section>
              <p>Over the past decade, business has changed dramatically. As a result, family workforce skills and requirements have also changed. There are family business jobs today that didn’t exist 10 years ago such as data analyst, social media manager and app developer. In five more years, there will be new roles with new requirements that don’t exist now. And while this has happened, schools at the secondary and post secondary level have not been training students in these new skills nor in skills for entrepreneurial thinking for family businesses. A specialized community education institute for family business is thus warranted.</p>
