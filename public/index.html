            <section>
              <p>The GFBI is a private not-for-profit corporation registered in Canada. The mission of the GFBI is to support and encourage the growth of family businesses globally by providing educational programs based on family business needs found through research. The research and educational programs will be implemented first in Central-Eastern Europe and at the local level and in partnership with their community organizations and educational providers.</p>

              <h1>What is the rationale for creating the GFBI?</h1>
            </header>
            <section>
              <p>Over the past decade, business has changed dramatically. As a result, family workforce skills and requirements have also changed. There are family business jobs today that didn’t exist 10 years ago such as data analyst, social media manager and app developer. In five more years, there will be new roles with new requirements that don’t exist now. And while this has happened, schools at the secondary and post secondary level have not been training students in these new skills nor in skills for entrepreneurial thinking for family businesses. A specialized community education institute for family business is thus warranted.</p>

            </header>
            <section>
              <p>1. To conduct and support research on the characteristics and challenges of family businesses to support local economic and social development. Initially focusing on Central-Eastern Europe and then globally as membership grows.</p>
              <p>2. To serve family businesses through the establishment of Global Family Business Institute ‘Support Centers’ in collaboration with local businesses, education institutions and community associations.</p>
              <p>3. To facilitate family businesses, at the ‘Support Centers’, with collaborative educational programs based on researched needs of family business regarding their challenges such as planning business transfer (succession), handling family disputes, expanding to new markets, adopting new technologies, and attracting, training and maintaining skilled workers;</p>
              <p>4. Developing a relevant Global Family Business Institute “best practices guide” for family businesses by major geographic region, starting with Central-Eastern Europe. And publishing a semi-annual summary of global research & findings on family business management practices. Further the GFBI may evaluate programs & offer regional and national data around entrepreneurial and family business programs. (a private-public partnership to foster economic & social development)</p>
